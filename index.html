   Our invention, the Buzzer for the Blind, is made to assist those who are blind adapt to navigating the world by using senses other than sight. The process of adapting to life without sight is already incredibly difficult, and we wanted to alleviate some of the stress of navigation. Our buzzer will activate and buzz whenever an object or a wall is near it. This will indicate that the user of the buzzer should stop. This will assist the user of the product in learning layouts of new places or homes, without simple trial and error.</p>
   <p class="center">Here is a <a href="https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/62ec2d8d-005f-4701-95be-ccc8e3d2d251?list=studio" target="_blank">demonstration</a> of the buzzer in use.</p>
<h2 style="color:blue"; class="h2">How The Buzzer Works</h2>
<p class="center">The buzzer is made up of only a few components that are simple to source and aquire: an  <a href="https://www.arduino.cc/" target="_blank">Arduino Uno</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3316" target="_blank">Time of Flight Sensor</a>, and a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/ip/Buzzer-with-Leads-3V/134993926?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=4506" target="_blank">wire activated buzzer</a>, along with some basic male-to-male and male-to-female wires. There is code saved onto the Arduino Uno that essentially reads the range that was measured by the Time of Flight Sensor and prints it. If the printed range was less than 198mm, pin 13 on the Arduino Uno would be digitally written to high, giving that pin power. The buzzer is connected to pin 13, and would buzz when it had energy flowing to it. If the sensor prints a range that is longer than 198mm, it will digitally write piin 13 to low, stopping energy from flowing to that pin and effectively turning the buzzer off.</p>
